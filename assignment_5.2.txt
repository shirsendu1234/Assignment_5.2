Our test statistic is less than -1.64 so it now falls into the critical region! We now Reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the 1973 data provide evidence that the true proportion of
students admitted to the graduate school of UCB in 1973 was significantly less than 40%.The
data are not consistent with the officer’s claim at the a=0.05 significance level.What is going on, here? If we choose a=0.05 then we reject the null hypothesis, but if we choose a=0.01 then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Our final conclusion seemsto depend on our selection of the significance level. This is bad; for a particular test, we never know whether our conclusion would have been different if we had chosen a different significance level.
